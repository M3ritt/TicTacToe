# TicTacToe
Version of TicTacToe that can be any size board. Made for 2 players but also can be played against a computer named Henry

Game initially starts with entering a board size, which only one number is required since board is a square. Number of players is then requested and will be either 1 or 2. Choose 1 Player if it is desired to play against Henry. 

Henry is not operational yet, so I do not recommend playing against him.
